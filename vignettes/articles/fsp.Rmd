```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(fsp)
```

## What this is supposed to be

The idea is to collate a set of functions and instructions for updating the
pocketbook in articles [usethis::use_article()] to make guidance for producing
items in the publication.

## Installation

You can install the development version of fsp from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("FoodchainStats/fsp")
```
