    In this section the package functions are listed by their operation. If you 
    want to do things step by step you'll use these to download and then wrangle
    data before processing the data into pocketbook format. You can view the
    same functions organised into pocketbook topics in the 'By topic' section.
- subtitle: URLs
  desc: >
    The urls that the package uses to access the data files. `url_*` functions 
    simply store the address of where the datasets are. They are used by other
    fsp functions to download data. If things arent working the first thing you
    can do is manually check these url to see that they are pointing to the
    right data.

- subtitle: Acquire data
  desc: >
    `acquire_*` functions actually download data. By default they download into
    a temporary file, but you can specify a folder to download to. These 
    functions return the path to the downloaded file. You can use the output of 
    `acquire_*` functions with, eg `read.csv()` or other similar functions.

- subtitle: Get data
  desc: >
    `get_*` functions wrap around `url` and `acquire`, reading in data and
    returning a tibble. In most cases they also do a bit of light processing, 
    eg cleaning up variable names. For some source datasets they may return an
    element of the underlying data, such as only the monthly or yearly data, or
    metadata about the dataset contents.
