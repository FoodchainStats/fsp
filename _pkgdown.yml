    In this section the package functions are listed by their operation. If you 
    want to do things step by step you'll use these to download and then wrangle
    data before processing the data into pocketbook format.
    
    Essentially you can use the `acquire_*` functions to download raw data, and 
    then apply the `get_*` functions to extract a useful tibble from it for 
    further processing. The `url` functions are basically for reference and not 
    needed in normal circumstances.
    
    
    _Normally you should just be able to use `get_*` and carry on from there. 
    The rest is just to show working and help with reproducibility_  
    
    
    **You can view the same functions organised into pocketbook topics in the
    'By topic' section.**
    
    
- subtitle: URLs
  desc: >
    `url_*` functions simply return the address of where the datasets are. They 
    are used by other fsp functions to download data. If things arent working
    the first thing you can do is manually check these url to see that they are 
    pointing to the right data.

- subtitle: Acquire data
  desc: >
    `acquire_*` functions actually download data. By default they download into
    a temporary file, but you can specify a folder to download to. These 
    functions return the path to the downloaded file. You can use the output of 
    `acquire_*` functions with, eg `read.csv()` or other similar functions.

- subtitle: Get data
  desc: >
    `get_*` functions wrap around `url` and `acquire`, reading in data and
    returning a tibble. In most cases they also do a bit of light processing, 
    eg cleaning up variable names. For some source datasets they may return an
    element of the underlying data, such as only the monthly or yearly data, or
    metadata about the dataset contents.
